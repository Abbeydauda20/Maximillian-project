By default, if you run a Container without -d, you run in "attached mode".

If you started a container in detached mode (i.e. with -d), you can still attach to it afterwards without restarting the Container with the following command:

docker attach CONTAINER
attaches you to a running Container with an ID or name of CONTAINER.
